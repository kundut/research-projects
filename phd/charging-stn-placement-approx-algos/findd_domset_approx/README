HOW TO RUN:
-----------
a) Change directory to <approach_>/examples

b) Following input files are needed in the "examples" directory:
     workspace.txt  obstacle.txt  2d_template.txt 

c) Execute   ./run.sh model_approx

d) Output will appear on the console


INPUT FILES:
------------
Following input files contain inputs to the program. We mention the attributes file-wise.

1. workspace.txt
<max x coordinate>
<max y coordinate>
<max d length>

2. obstacle.txt contains obstacle grid positions (2-D)

3. 2d_template.txt contains motion primitive details of a given robot.
Each primitive contains the following :
<primitive id>
<initial velocity>
<final velocity>
<displacement of [x, y] distance from current position>
<cost of applying this primitive>
<time required to apply this primitive>
<swath locations from the current location, while applied>
